    <h2>The Role of German in Artificial Intelligence</h2>
    <p>
      The German language plays a growing role in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). 
      Germany is a leading nation in machine learning research, natural language processing, 
      and robotics. Many AI systems are developed and trained on multilingual datasets, 
      including German, to ensure better understanding of European linguistic diversity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Universities such as <strong>Technical University of Munich (TUM)</strong> and 
      <strong>University of Tübingen</strong> have advanced AI research centers that 
      collaborate with global companies like Siemens, SAP, and Bosch.
